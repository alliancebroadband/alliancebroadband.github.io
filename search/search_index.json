Just another Alliance customer with lots of time to waste (not an employee). All views shared here are mine and do not reflect Alliance Broadband (the ISP) at all. Don't sue me. Are you making money out of this? Absolutely not. No ads or trackers present in the site. How are you getting the data? The data is completely crowsourced . I ask people for the data, and if they share, I upload it. Won't hackers be able to use it? Anybody can easily find out all this data with any standard network sniffer or by simply asking around. What kind of data will you host? As of now, i'll be keeping the following data Pincode Locality name LCO name LCO phone number Equipment type provided: CAT5/Fiber/Both Last updated Confirmed by Cost of a new connection This can change as per requirement How did you make this website? I am using a static website generator called mkdocs which allows me to quickly create websites using Markdown . I'm hosting on Github Pages . How can I contribute? You can contribute in two ways Provide me with details regarding your local LCO. You should be a current customer under that LCO so that I can verify the data. If you can write interesting articles regarding Alliance/Wifi/Internet in Markdown, I shall put it up in the site. Written articles must be factual, possibly with references (no opinion pieces allowed). Can you add X feature into the website? No. If the suggestion is useful and easy, I might think about it.","title":"Site FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#site-faq","text":"","title":"Site FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#who-are-you","text":"Just another Alliance customer with lots of time to waste (not an employee).
