I saw that the Alliance community does not have kind of central knowledge base for some of the most basic information required by customer. I hope this site can at least answer some of those questions. Who are you? Just another Alliance customer with lots of time to waste (not an employee). All views shared here are mine and do not reflect Alliance Broadband (the ISP) at all. Don't sue me. Are you making money out of this? Absolutely not. No ads or trackers present in the site. How are you getting the data? The data is completely crowsourced . I ask people for the data, and if they share, I upload it. Won't hackers be able to use it? Anybody can easily find out all this data with any standard network sniffer or by simply asking around. What kind of data will you host? As of now, i'll be keeping the following data Pincode Locality name LCO name LCO phone number Equipment type provided: CAT5/Fiber/Both Last updated Confirmed by Cost of a new connection This can change as per requirement How did you make this website? I am using a static website generator called mkdocs which allows me to quickly create websites using Markdown . I'm hosting on Github Pages . How can I contribute? You can contribute in two ways Provide me with details regarding your local LCO. You should be a current customer under that LCO so that I can verify the data. If you can write interesting articles regarding Alliance/Wifi/Internet in Markdown, I shall put it up in the site. Written articles must be factual, possibly with references (no opinion pieces allowed). Can you add X feature into the website? No. If the suggestion is useful and easy, I might think about it. How do I contact you? You can contact me via Facebook : Xavier Noobism Email : alliancefaq < @ > gmail < dot > com Best would be to join the ABSPL group , as I'm active there and don't check the mail often.

What are the advantages of upgrading to a fibre connection? Many customers want to shift to an optical fibre connection. It certainly is the most reliable form of transportation of signals. Broadly speaking, an optical fibre based connection has several advantages over a standard copper ethernet connection, such as Support for much higher bandwidth rates Lesser packet drop probability rate due to immunity from EM interference Virtually impossible to be tapped physically (unless you have some very specialized hardware) Signal propagation in optical fibre is faster compared to copper wires ( Optical signal verses electrical signal ) However, considering the scenario in India, it's mostly hype and a marketing tactic. Let us re-examine the above points Less than 0.1% of users in India use a 1G internet, which is well within the limits of CAT 5e cables Packet drop in Cat 5e cables due to interference is a very rare event. You are more likely to face packet drop due to link congestion , faulty hardware , faulty switch configuration or other human errors . If these underlying causes are not resolved, even optical fibre will not solve the issue . As long as you are using HTTPS , wire tapping is not an issue. Also, unless the entire infrastucture is not using optical fibre, then the weakest link still remains open for an attacker. Difference in signal propagation is imperceptible for most users. But depending on your hardware and the LCO's hardware, you can slightly reduce your latency. This can be beneficial to people who use latency-sensitive applications , such as online gaming. An Optical Fibre Storage Enclosure - Needs a lot of space to avoid bends There are some other negatives of optical fibre as well, such as High setup cost Optical cables cannot bend like copper cables, as the medium is not as malleable as copper. You need a seperate power point for the Optical Network Terminal (ONU). In our case, an ONU converts an optical signal to an electrical signal which can be understood by a ethernet router. TP1001-GE -1 GE ONU So bottom line is, unless you really know what you want AND you have money to spare, there is no reason for shifting to an optical connection. Instead, shift to a Cat 5e cable , that too, if your internet package is rated above 100 Mbps (Mainly because it's easier and faster for your LCO to upgrade to Cat 5e than optical fibre ) Cat 5e - Good Enough! Conclusion I'm not advocating against optical fibre. If your LCO is offering you the chance to upgrade, then go for it. However, understand that an optical connection will not magically solve all your existing problems because they are mostly man-made. ISPs need to upgrade their backbone connection with better switches for their to be any tangible benefit for us. What is the cost of a new connection? I want to buy a router. Which router should I buy? Which is the best router? I can only connect to a few websites. How do I fix this? I bought a new router. How do I setup it up? Why do some people have great connection while I don't? Static IP What is a static IP? Why would one want a static IP? How do I get a static IP? My connection is terrible.
