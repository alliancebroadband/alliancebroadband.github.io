I hope this site can at least answer some of those questions. Who are you? Just another Alliance customer with lots of time to waste (not an employee). All views shared here are mine and do not reflect Alliance Broadband (the ISP) at all. Don't sue me. Are you making money out of this? Absolutely not. No ads or trackers present in the site. How are you getting the data? The data is completely crowsourced . I ask people for the data, and if they share, I upload it. Won't hackers be able to use it? Anybody can easily find out all this data with any standard network sniffer or by simply asking around. What kind of data will you host? As of now, i'll be keeping the following data Pincode Locality name LCO name LCO phone number Equipment type provided: CAT5/Fiber/Both Last updated Confirmed by Cost of a new connection This can change as per requirement How did you make this website?

You can contribute in two ways Provide me with details regarding your local LCO. You should be a current customer under that LCO so that I can verify the data. If you can write interesting articles regarding Alliance/Wifi/Internet in Markdown, I shall put it up in the site.

Many customers want to shift to an optical fibre connection. It certainly is the most reliable form of transportation of signals. Broadly speaking, an optical fibre based connection has several advantages over a standard copper ethernet connection, such as Support for much higher bandwidth rates Lesser packet drop probability rate due to immunity from EM interference Virtually impossible to be tapped physically (unless you have some very specialized hardware) Signal propagation in optical fibre is faster compared to copper wires ( Optical signal verses electrical signal ) However, considering the scenario in India, let us re-examine the above points Less than 0.1% of users in India use a 1G internet, which is well within the limits of CAT 5e cables. Packet drop in Cat 5e cables due to interference is a very rare event. You are more likely to face packet drop due to link congestion , faulty hardware , faulty switch configuration or other human errors . If these underlying causes are not resolved, even optical fibre will not solve the issue . As long as you are using HTTPS , wire tapping is not an issue. Also, unless the entire infrastucture is not using optical fibre, then the weakest link still remains open for an attacker. Difference in signal propagation is imperceptible for most users. But depending on your hardware and the LCO's hardware, you can slightly reduce your latency. This can be beneficial to people who use latency-sensitive applications , such as online gaming. An Optical Fibre Storage Enclosure - Needs a lot of space to avoid bends There are some other negatives of optical fibre as well, such as It has a high initial setup cost It cannot bend like copper cables, as the medium is not as malleable as copper. You need a proper storage area for the excess cable. You need a seperate power point for the Optical Network Terminal (ONU). In our case, an ONU converts an optical signal to an electrical signal which can be understood by a ethernet router. TP1001-GE -1 GE ONU However, there are some practical advantages as well Lower chance of connection disruption during lightning, since optical fibre does not conduct electricity. But the middleboxes are still suseptible to failure due to lightning. Low signal attenuation compared to copper cables (Copper cables are rated for a maximum of 100m). Hence, longer cables can be used, which implies lower number of point of failures . Once set, there is much lower maintenance because of overall robustness. So, switching to fibre has the following REAL benefits to a customer Fewer connection disruption in case of inclement weather A more reliable connection, since it requires lesser maintenance Slightly better latency Completely future proof If your LCO still does not provide optical fibre, you can instead shift to a Cat 5e cable . But it only makes sense if your internet package is rated above 100 Mbps . This is because it's easier and faster for your LCO to upgrade to Cat 5e than optical fibre . Cat 5e - Good Enough! Conclusion I'm not advocating against optical fibre. If your LCO is offering you the chance to upgrade, then go for it. However, understand that an optical connection will not magically solve all your existing problems because they are mostly man-made, barring few nataral phenomenon. Both ISPs and LCOs need to upgrade their backbone connection with better hardware for their to be any tangible benefit for us. How do I pay online? Alliance Broadband has two methods of online payment The official Alliance payment gateway The Paytm portal of Alliance Both the methods work well, but the Paytm portal has two advantages You receive push notifications of you have bills which are due, provided you have the Paytm app Paytm remembers your Alliance Customer ID, so the payment is very seamless NOTE : Don't trust payment links on random websites. Always cross-verify with Google. How do I change my current plan? Alliance does not provide the subscribers a way to change their plan on their own. You can only change your plan via your LCO. Here's how to do it Contact your LCO Let him know to which plan you want to shift The LCO will make the first payment for the new plan Now you have shifted to a new plan. Henceforth, you can now make normal payments like before. I can only connect to a few websites. How do I fix this? This can sometimes happen and is a temporary issue. But you can fix it by changing the ISP-provided DNS. By default, Alliance provides the Google DNS . Some LCOs also set the default gateway as DNS server. You can change it to another very reliable DNS provider; Cloudflare ( 1.1.1.1 ). You can read more other DNS providers here What is the cost involved in upgrading to a fibre connection?
