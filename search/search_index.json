They will forward the contact details of the Local Cable Operator (LCO) who will provide you with the connection. If you subscribe to a local cable provider for television, you can also ask him/her for a new connection. You can check here if your LCO provides an Alliance connection. Important: Before you take a new connection, talk with existing Alliance customers your neighbourhood. Ask them about the experience, bandwidth, downtimes, service and support. If these parameters are to your liking, then go ahead. DO NOT CHECK ONLINE , as experience varies a lot among different LCOs, who are in different parts of the city. What is the cost of a new connection? The cost of a new connection varies depending on your Local Cable Operator. However, the general concensus is that it's around \u20b92500/-. With a new connection, you only receive an ethernet cable to your residence. If you also want Wi-Fi, then you will require a Wi-Fi router, which will cost extra. It is recommended to buy a router separately. How do I login? Alliance uses a browser-based login system. If you are connected properly, then open any browser. You will automatically be directed to a login page. The login page should look like this. Enter your username and password and you should be able to login. Bonus Information The login IP should be of the following format http://10.254.254.x/0/up The value of x in the IP varies from LCO to LCO. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER IP FOR LOGIN , especially if you have received from your friend, as it might not be safe. How do I pay/recharge online? Alliance Broadband has two methods of online payment The official Alliance payment gateway The Paytm portal of Alliance Both the methods work well, but the Paytm portal has two advantages You receive push notifications of you have bills which are due, provided you have the Paytm app Paytm remembers your Alliance Customer ID, so the payment is very seamless NOTE: Don't trust payment links on random websites. Always cross-verify with Google. How do I change my current plan? Alliance does not provide the subscribers a way to change their plan on their own. You can only change your plan via your LCO. Here's how to do it Contact your LCO Let him know to which plan you want to shift The LCO will make the first payment for the new plan Now you have shifted to a new plan. Henceforth, you can now make normal payments like before. I can only connect to a few websites. How do I fix this? This can sometimes happen and is a temporary issue. But you can fix it by changing the ISP-provided DNS. By default, Alliance provides the Google DNS . Some LCOs also set the default gateway as DNS server. You can change it to another very reliable DNS provider; Cloudflare ( 1.1.1.1 ). You can read more other DNS providers here I bought a new router. But why can't I connect to the internet?

Many customers want to shift to an optical fibre connection. It certainly is the latest and most reliable form of transportation of signals. Broadly speaking, an optical fibre based connection has several advantages over a standard copper ethernet connection, such as Support for much higher bandwidth rates Lesser packet drop probability rate due to immunity from EM interference Virtually impossible to be tapped physically (unless you have some very specialized hardware) Signal propagation in optical fibre is faster compared to copper wires ( Optical signal verses electrical signal ) However, considering the scenario in India, let us re-examine the above points Less than 0.1% of users in India use a 1G internet, which is well within the limits of CAT 5e cables. Packet drop in Cat 5e cables due to interference is a very rare event. You are more likely to face packet drop due to link congestion , faulty hardware , faulty switch configuration or other human errors . If these underlying causes are not resolved, even optical fibre will not solve the issue . As long as you are using HTTPS , wire tapping is not an issue. Also, unless the entire infrastucture is not using optical fibre, then the weakest link still remains open for an attacker. Difference in signal propagation is imperceptible for most users. But depending on your hardware and the LCO's hardware, you can slightly reduce your latency. This can be beneficial to people who use latency-sensitive applications , such as online gaming. An Optical Fibre Storage Enclosure - Needs a lot of space to avoid bends There are some other negatives of optical fibre as well, such as It has a high initial setup cost It cannot bend like copper cables, as the medium is not as malleable as copper. You need a proper storage area for the excess cable. You need a seperate power point for the Optical Network Terminal (ONU). In our case, an ONU converts an optical signal to an electrical signal which can be understood by a ethernet router. TP1001-GE -1 GE ONU However, there are some practical advantages as well Lower chance of connection disruption during lightning, since optical fibre does not conduct electricity. But the middleboxes are still suseptible to failure due to lightning. Low signal attenuation compared to copper cables (Copper cables are rated for a maximum of 100m). Hence, longer cables can be used, which implies lower number of point of failures . Once set, there is much lower maintenance because of overall robustness. So, switching to fibre has the following REAL benefits to a customer Fewer connection disruption in case of inclement weather A more reliable connection, since it requires lesser maintenance Slightly better latency Completely future proof If your LCO still does not provide optical fibre, you can instead shift to a Cat 5e cable . But it only makes sense if your internet package is rated above 100 Mbps . This is because it's easier and faster for your LCO to upgrade to Cat 5e than optical fibre . Cat 5e - Good Enough! Conclusion I'm not advocating against optical fibre. If your LCO is offering you the chance to upgrade, then go for it. However, understand that an optical connection will not magically solve all your existing problems because they are mostly man-made, barring few nataral phenomenon. Both ISPs and LCOs need to upgrade their backbone connection with better hardware for their to be any tangible benefit for us.","title":"Should I upgrade to a fibre connection?"},{"location":"kbase/articles/fibre_upgrade/#should-i-upgrade-to-a-fibre-connection","text":"Many customers want to shift to an optical fibre connection. It certainly is the latest and most reliable form of transportation of signals. Broadly speaking, an optical fibre based connection has several advantages over a standard copper ethernet connection, such as Support for much higher bandwidth rates Lesser packet drop probability rate due to immunity from EM interference Virtually impossible to be tapped physically (unless you have some very specialized hardware) Signal propagation in optical fibre is faster compared to copper wires ( Optical signal verses electrical signal ) However, considering the scenario in India, let us re-examine the above points Less than 0.1% of users in India use a 1G internet, which is well within the limits of CAT 5e cables. Packet drop in Cat 5e cables due to interference is a very rare event. You are more likely to face packet drop due to link congestion , faulty hardware , faulty switch configuration or other human errors . If these underlying causes are not resolved, even optical fibre will not solve the issue . As long as you are using HTTPS , wire tapping is not an issue. Also, unless the entire infrastucture is not using optical fibre, then the weakest link still remains open for an attacker. Difference in signal propagation is imperceptible for most users. But depending on your hardware and the LCO's hardware, you can slightly reduce your latency. This can be beneficial to people who use latency-sensitive applications , such as online gaming. An Optical Fibre Storage Enclosure - Needs a lot of space to avoid bends There are some other negatives of optical fibre as well, such as It has a high initial setup cost It cannot bend like copper cables, as the medium is not as malleable as copper. You need a proper storage area for the excess cable. You need a seperate power point for the Optical Network Terminal (ONU). In our case, an ONU converts an optical signal to an electrical signal which can be understood by a ethernet router. TP1001-GE -1 GE ONU However, there are some practical advantages as well Lower chance of connection disruption during lightning, since optical fibre does not conduct electricity. But the middleboxes are still suseptible to failure due to lightning. Low signal attenuation compared to copper cables (Copper cables are rated for a maximum of 100m). Hence, longer cables can be used, which implies lower number of point of failures . Once set, there is much lower maintenance because of overall robustness. So, switching to fibre has the following REAL benefits to a customer Fewer connection disruption in case of inclement weather A more reliable connection, since it requires lesser maintenance Slightly better latency Completely future proof If your LCO still does not provide optical fibre, you can instead shift to a Cat 5e cable . But it only makes sense if your internet package is rated above 100 Mbps . This is because it's easier and faster for your LCO to upgrade to Cat 5e than optical fibre .

Crash course in Internet Architecture Before I try to answer the titular question, we need to have a basic understanding of the different types of ISPs. There are three types of ISPs ; Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 ISPs. They are similar to international, national and state highways. Let's see how they work. Tier 1 ISP These are international origanizations, and they must be connected to all other Tier 1 ISPs. They provide connections to entire countries. Normally, individuals and businesses don't interact with them directly. Tier 2 ISP These ISPs are connected to both Tier 1 ISPs and Tier 2 ISPs. These are the gateways to internet for an entire country, and they have a country wide presence. They buy bandwidth and IP ranges from Tier 1 ISPs and provide them to the users. These can be availed by both individual customers and businesses. Tier 3 ISP These ISPs buy bandwidth and IP ranges from Tier 2 ISPs and provide them to the end users. They generally have a state or even city-wide presence only. Home users and small businesses typically avail their services. ISP Heirarchy BSNL, Airtel & Reliance are Tier 2 ISPs Alliance, Wishnet and GPTL are Tier 3 ISPs By looking at the heirarchy of ISPs, you can understand that higher tier ISPs generally have more capital and have greater geographical reach. If you buy a connection from a Tier 2 ISP, they have the ability to give you a connection direct from their own distribution center. A Tier 3 ISP, on the other hand, can bring a connection near your locality, but not directly to your house. This direct connection to an end-user is called \"last-mile-connectivity\" . This last-mile-connectivity is provided by... Local Cable Operators (LCO) LCOs set up a network between every residence to his own local hub. Then, the LCO needs to buy internet from a Tier 3 ISP. LCOs plugging in your cable. Easy! How do they operate? They generally have a small team, mostly in the single-digits They provide network to a very small locality They decide what kind of physical connection you receive (fibre or copper cables) Most of the time, they also provide cable TV as well In case of physical damage, they are responsible for repairing it since the infrastructure belongs to them Who do LCOs work for? LCOs don't have a employer; they have partners. Alliance Broadband is one of their partners. A Tier 3 ISP provides internet to the LCO, and the LCO provides the ISP with a pool of customers. The ISP and LCO agree upon a division of profit, for example 70-30; that is, 70% of the profits go to the ISP, and the rest to the LCO. Why is there difference in service between different LCOs? LCOs are small teams, and they don't have a large budget. Some LCOs, who have a large pool of customers, can afford to buy better hardware and provide them to his customers. The hardware an LCO maintains consists of L2/L3 switches Signal boosters/repeaters Cable (fibre/copper) An LCO cannot afford to buy the best quality of hardware. They buy what is decent and resonable. On the other hand, some LCOs can be \"less efficient/competent\". Customers under them generally don't have a good experience. Hence the difference in service. Which is why, customers under Tier 3 ISPs have such a varied experience, since it ultimately boils down to their LCO's ability. Watching the RTOs increasing The Stalemate between LCOs and ISPs You might think that if an LCO is underperforming, the ISP will come out of the partnership, but that almost never happens. If the ISP walks out, the ISP looses lots of customers . The LCO, on the otherhand, will simply switch to other ISP . The other ISP will gladly take in the influx of new customers. Why do people even use Tier-3 ISPs? There are mainly three reasons Tier 3 ISPs offer very cheap internet Tier 3 ISPs offer unlimited internet plans without any Fair Usage Policy (FUP). In FUP plans, the ISP will reduce your bandwidth after you have consumed a certain amount of data. Most Tier 2 ISPs have very expensive unlimited internet plans and some don't even offer any such plans. Tier 3 ISPs rely on a LCO to create the last-mile-connectivity, which otherwise would be expensive for small Tier 3 ISPs, since they have a small number of connection exchanges. What can I, as a customer, do break this stalemate? Nothing. This model exists because we Indians like cheap things. Connectivity issues will continue to exist as long as LCO uses sub-standard hardware Tier 3 ISPs overcommit bandwidth Overcommitting means that they buy lesser bandwidth compared to the number of customers. This because of the assumption that not all customers will use the internet at the same time. This is not a situation unique to ISPs; it's a tried and tested technique in datacenters . The problem is more visible now because how COVID forced people to use their residential extensively. Connectivity issues are not always the LCOs fault. However, most of the time they are the weakest link since they use off-the-shelf hardware. Identifying the exact cause is hard to determine, especially for an customer. Complaining to the ISP about your LCO will rarely help. Instead, you can try to determine where exactly the problem is occuring. Try asking yourself, the following question Is the connectivity issue occuring at Your router? Your local gateway? The ISP's egress switch? The server you are trying to access? The above list is ordered by more probable to less probable . How do you answer the above questions? A friend under the same LCO is facing no issues A friend under a different LCO but same ISP is facing no issues A friend under a different ISP is facing no issues Everyone is facing the same issue Now you know who to blame Point 1 True - Blame yourself Point 2 True - Blame your LCO Point 3 True - Blame your ISP Point 4 True - Blame the server manager Conclusion Here is a controversial opinion; if your livelihood is critically dependant on your internet, have a backup network connection, or subscribe to a Tier 2 ISP. A Tier 2 ISP provides the following guarantees Stable connection, not dependant on weather. Some degree of QoS assurances Uniform customer experience However, you pay a premium for the above services. Tier 3 ISPs are mainly for residential areas.
