<h1 id="what-is-the-relation-between-an-lco-and-an-isp">What is the relation between an LCO and an ISP?</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="crash-course-in-internet-architecture">Crash course in Internet Architecture</h2>
<hr />
<p>Before I try to answer the titular question, we need to have a basic understanding of the different types of ISPs.</p>
<!--
I'll explain it by comparing it to the road system, which is very similar to how the Internet works.
-->

<p>There there three types of ISPs; Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 ISPs.
They are similar to international, national and state highways.
Let's see how they work.</p>
<h3 id="tier-1-isp">Tier 1 ISP</h3>
<p>These are international origanizations, and they must be connected to all other Tier 1 ISPs.
They provide connections to entire countries.
Normally, individuals and businesses don't interact with them directly.</p>
<h3 id="tier-2-isp">Tier 2 ISP</h3>
<p>These ISPs are connected to both Tier 1 ISPs and Tier 2 ISPs.
These are the gateways to internet for an entire country, and they have a country wide presence.
They buy bandwidth and IP ranges from Tier 1 ISPs and provide them to the users.
These can be availed by both individual customers and businesses.</p>
<h3 id="tier-3-isp">Tier 3 ISP</h3>
<p>These ISPs buy bandwidth and IP ranges from Tier 2 ISPs and provide them to the end users.
They generally have a state or even city-wide presence only.
Home users and small businesses typically avail their services.</p>
<!-- Image showing heirarchy -->

<p><em>BSNL, Airtel &amp; Reliance are Tier 2 ISPs</em></p>
<p><em>Alliance, Wishnet and GPTL are Tier 3 ISPs</em></p>
<p>By looking at the heirarchy of ISPs, you can understand that higher tier ISPs generally have more capital and have greater geographical reach.
If you buy a connection from a Tier 2 ISP, they have the ability to give you a connection direct from their own distribution center.</p>
<p>A Tier 3 ISP, on the other hand, can bring a connection near your locality, but not directly to your house.
This direct connection to an end-user is called <em>"last-mile-connectivity"</em>.
This last-mile-connectivity is provided by...</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="local-cable-operators-lco">Local Cable Operators (LCO)</h2>
<hr />
<p>LCOs set up a network between every residence to his own local hub.
Then, the LCO needs to buy internet from a Tier 3 ISP.</p>
<!-- Image showing LCO working -->

<h3 id="how-do-they-operate">How do they operate?</h3>
<ul>
<li>They generally have a small team, mostly in the single-digits</li>
<li>They provide network to a very small locality</li>
<li>They decide what kind of physical connection you receive (fibre or copper cables)</li>
<li>Most of the time, they also provide cable TV as well</li>
<li>In case of physical damage, they are responsible for repairing it since the infrastructure belongs to them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-do-lcos-work-for">Who do LCOs work for?</h2>
<hr />
<!-- Image showing partnership -->

<p>LCOs don't have a employer; they have partner.
Alliance Broadband is one of their partners.
A Tier 3 ISP provides internet to the LCO, and the LCO provides the ISP with a pool of customers.
The ISP and LCO agree upon a division of profit, something like 70-30; that is, 70% of the profits go to the ISP, and the rest to the LCO.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-there-difference-in-service-between-different-lcos">Why is there difference in service between different LCOs?</h2>
<hr />
<p>LCOs are small teams, and they don't have a large budget.
Some LCOs, who have a large pool of customers, can afford to buy better hardware and provide them to his customers.
The hardware an LCO maintains consists of </p>
<ol>
<li>L2/L3 switches</li>
<li>Signal boosters/repeaters</li>
<li>Cable (fibre/copper)</li>
</ol>
<p>An LCO cannot afford to buy the best quality of hardware.
They buy what is decent and resonable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some LCOs can be "less efficient/competent".
Customers under them generally don't have a good experience.
Hence the difference in service.</p>
<p>Which is why, customers under Tier 3 ISPs have such a varied experience, since it ultimately boils down to their LCO's ability.</p>
<!-- Image showing partnership -->

<h2 id="the-stalemate-between-lcos-and-isps">The Stalemate between LCOs and ISPs</h2>
<hr />
<p>You might think that if an LCO is underperforming, the ISP will come out of the partnership, but that almost never happens.
If the ISP walks out, the <em>ISP looses lots of customers</em>.
The LCO, on the otherhand, will simply <em>switch to other ISP</em>.
The other ISP will gladly take in the influx of new customers.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-people-even-use-tier-3-isps">Why do people even use Tier-3 ISPs?</h2>
<hr />
<p>There are mainly three reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 3 ISPs offer very cheap internet</li>
<li>Tier 3 ISPs offer unlimited internet without any Fair Usage Policy (FUP).
In FUP plans, the ISP will reduce your bandwidth after you have consumed a certain amount of data.
Most Tier 2 ISPs have very expensive unlimited internet plans and some don't even offer any such plans.</li>
<li>Tier 3 ISPs rely on a LCO to create the last-mile-connectivity, which otherwise would be expensive for small Tier 3 ISPs, since they have a small number of connection exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-can-i-as-a-customer-do-break-this-stalemate">What can I as a customer do break this stalemate?</h2>
<hr />
<p>Connectivity issues are not always the LCOs fault.
However, most of the time they are the weakest link since they use of the shelf hardware.
Identifying the exact cause is hard to determine, especially for an customer.</p>
<p>Complaining to the ISP about your LCO will rarely help.
Instead, you can try to determine where exactly the problem is occuring.
Try asking yourself, the following question</p>
<p>Is the connectivity issue occuring at</p>
<ol>
<li>Your router?</li>
<li>Your local gateway?</li>
<li>The ISP's egress switch?</li>
<li>The server you are trying to access?</li>
</ol>
<p>The above list is ordered by <strong>more probable</strong> to <strong>less probable</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<hr />
<p>Here is a controversial opinion; if your livelihood is critically dependant on your internet, have a backup network connection, or subscribe to a Tier 2 ISP.</p>
<p>A Tier 2 ISP provides the following guarantees</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable connection, not dependant on weather.</li>
<li>Some degree of QoS assurances</li>
<li>Uniform customer experience</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you do pay a premium for the above services.</p>
<p>Tier 3 ISPs are mainly for residential areas.
COVID-19 has flipped the scenario but we have to work with what we have got.</p></div>
